# How to Contribute

## CI

* A CI pipeline is setup in github [actions](https://github.com/tqjxlm/Sparkle/actions) at .github/workflows/ci.yml
* Pushing tags will generate releases on github. The release process is defined in .github/workflows/release.yml.
* All PRs are required to pass CI before merging.
* For now, there's only building test. I will add unit test, functional test, performance test and style check later.
* Archived builds will be uploaded on successful runs. You can download them from the [actions](https://github.com/tqjxlm/Sparkle/actions) page.
  * NOTICE: only download artifacts from workflow triggered by yourself. Security cannot be guaranteed for artifacts generated by untrusted developers.
  * NOTICE: due to certificate limitation, iOS artifacts cannot be installed on your machine. Please build with your own developer account to test them. Or you can ask me to register your device in my privsioning profile.
